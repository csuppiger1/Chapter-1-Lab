Class name different from file name. Delete one l (el) from the name of the class (so the first non-comment line is public class Helo), save the program, and recompile it. Is there an error message, if so what was the error message?
Answer: No errors
Misspelling inside string. Correct the mistake above, then delete one l from the Hello in the message to be printed (inside the quotation marks). Save the program and recompile it. There is no error messageâ€”why not? Now run the program. What has changed?
Answer: There isn't an error message because the computer thinks you want to print Helo.
No ending quotation mark in a string literal. Correct the spelling in the string, then delete the ending quotation mark enclosing the string Hello, World!. Save the program and recompile it. What error message(s) do you get?
Answer: unclosed string literal.
No beginning quotation mark in a string literal. Put the ending quotation mark back, then take out the beginning one. Save and recompile. How many errors this time? Lots, even though there is really only one error. When you get lots of errors always concentrate on finding the first one listed!! Often fixing that one will fix the rest. After we study variables the error messages that came up this time will make more sense.
Answer: unclose string literal.
No semicolon after a statement. Fix the last error (put the quotation mark back). Now remove the semicolon at the end of the line that prints the message. Save the program and recompile it. What error message(s) do you get?
Answer: ';' expected
